1769004918,435698,9,11,Bowdoin Escalator 125 (Lobby to street) is unavailable until further notice pending replacement. ,"The escalator will remain out of service for the foreseeable future. This decision was made after a thorough inspection determined that corrosion on the escalator’s steel truss was so severe that it could not be repaired further and that a complete replacement of the escalator would be required. Replacing the escalator at this location requires a more extended unit meeting modern escalator safety requirements. This longer unit will require significant alteration to the station entrance to meet code requirements. The MBTA has currently begun design work to understand what station upgrades will be needed. 
  
Due to these complexities, we expect the escalator will remain out of service for a significant time. We recognize the challenges this poses to our riders, and please know we are working to identify a solution as quickly as possible. In the meantime, Government Center Station, which is fully accessible and serves the Blue Line, is under a quarter-mile from Bowdoin Station.
